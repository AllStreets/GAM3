# HYPERION

*The watch from above.*

A browser game about running a private orbital agency over a living Earth —
real orbital mechanics, real live world events, and an AI-woven world that
grows differently for every player.

**Status:** Plan 7B (Soul & Spectacle) shipped — named satellites with specializations, service records & real loss; per-user agency archetypes that flavor the AI; scored maneuvers & orbital trick-shots; a cinematic completion set-piece; debris-conjunction emergencies; a "while you were away" cold-open; first-run walkthrough; orbital postcards.

## Stack

Next.js (App Router) · Three.js · Neon Postgres + Clerk (via Vercel
Marketplace, from Plan 3) · Anthropic API (from Plan 5)

## Develop

    pnpm install
    pnpm dev        # http://localhost:3100
    pnpm test       # unit tests (orbital/geo math)
    pnpm e2e        # Playwright smoke test

## Environment

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — server-side only, enables AI briefings (omit for deterministic fallback).
